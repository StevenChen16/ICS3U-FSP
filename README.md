1. **Topic:**      

 

-        **Topic**: Java Arrays and Array Operations 

-        **Theme**: Interactive Learning System for Array Data Structure

 

1. **Description:**      

 

-        This project will create an educational software application designed to teach Java Arrays through an interactive Computer-Assisted Instruction (CAI) system. The application will consist of four main screens: a main menu for navigation, a concept learning screen with interactive demonstrations of array operations, an activity screen for hands-on practice with arrays, and an assessment screen for knowledge evaluation. The software will utilize Java Swing for the GUI implementation, providing a user-friendly interface for students to learn array concepts, practice array manipulations, and test their understanding.

The four screens include:

1.     **Main Menu Screen**: Central navigation hub with options to access different sections

2.     **Concepts Screen**: Educational content with array theory and visual demonstrations

3.     **Activity Screen**: Interactive exercises for practicing array operations

4.     **Assessment Screen**: Quizzes and programming challenges for self-evaluation
